                  <p class="card-text">After Abandoning my Food Project in the third month of the semester, I went back to focusing on school, the contrast from pursuing several projects at once to going back to the school pace made school seem boring. I began acing my classes and being the most experienced programmer in my college classes with essentialy no effort. I had competitors earlier in my first years of college, but the gap created by experience was too large, I could feel the distance from my classmates. I don't remember most of the events of the spring 2021 semester since it was so uninteresting. But I still felt like I knew nothing, and I still felt like there was so much to learn <span class="badge badge-warning"><strong>as there is</strong></span>. <br>
                  <br>I've become more aware of all I don't understand and know as I learn more, It was just like the philosopher said, I trully know nothing. Though my interests make the range a lot shorter. I spent the entirety of the coming summer learning <span class="badge badge-info">C++</span>. I didn't know what I was missing so I studied and studied more, I truly appreciate everyone that has given me the opportunity to know so much. <span class="badge badge-secondary">Including the countless youtube tutorials</span>
                  <br><br>
                  I have become proficient at using <span class="badge badge-info">C++</span>, even moreso than <span class="badge badge-warning">Javascript</span>, but I don't any projects large enough to add to my portfolio. I currently understand the importance of data structures, OOP, and algorithms, and I'm finding ways to learn more.</p>

I've come to understand and appreciate Servers and web design, but no preject had ever been as engaging. <br> <br>I created this text-based game with a really AGILE mindset, though I didn't know what AGILE was at the time, It was just really bad planning, the potentional bugs are very high, though I've dealt with most of them. I gave up when I realized the exponential nature of the growth of bugs per each update. I am really interested in games like this, and will be properly implementing it after I graduate as a personal project.<br> This game will never be completed, at least not as in this language, <span class="badge badge-warning">Javascript</span> is fine, but It truly can not hold a candle to <span class="badge badge-info">C++</span></p>

I wasn't sure how much effort my team was going to put into the work, so I decided to make my own failsafe just in case. The "true" final project ended being a copy of the easier portions of my version since my team-members weren't very experienced with programming concepts at the time. I became a sort of personal tutor for my team-members, It was mentally engaging and thrilling to juggle the tutorship, a job, college-ness in general and the bootcamp, I can't even juggle in real life and I had ZERO coffee. I had a lot of fun that semester and learned a lot of  programming concepts and techniques.<br><br>The bootcamp was where I gained access to codecademy from, it was entirely free for around 3 months and I didn't waste the resource, I trully perfected my novice-hood in <span class="badge badge-warning">Javascript</span> in the time </p>

                      <p>I've never been a fan of css, So I never attempted learning more about it as it was always a bother, I really appreciate imported stylesheets. I did learn about Sass, and some css innovations which are more engaging</p>
